| Case | Status | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| TC-B02 | manual | Requires clock fast-forward to expiry window not controllable from the app UI. |
| TC-B06 | manual | Requires Stripe test decline card path; not deterministic from UI without a seeded decline fixture. |
| TC-C03 | manual | Needs clock fast-forward to expiry. |
| TC-G01 | manual | Scheduled push delivery not observable in simulator; deep-link target verified separately. |
| TC-G02 | manual | Scheduled push delivery not observable in simulator. |
| TC-G03 | manual | Throttle window is server-side; not deterministic from UI. |
| TC-M13 | manual | Requires a second actor to mutate availability while the cart screen is open (realtime). Not deterministic single-device. |
| TC-Q11 | manual | Requires a review aged >24h (clock control). |
| TC-Q13 | manual | Requires a recent review within 30 days across two trades (time + data). |
| TC-Q14 | manual | Requires clock control around completion time. |
| TC-Q16 | manual | Requires 3 distinct reporters; backend threshold effect. |
| TC-R03 | manual | Requires clock fast-forward to expiry. |
| TC-R04 | manual | Requires Stripe decline-card fixture. |
| TC-R11 | manual | Push delivery not observable in simulator. |
| TC-R12 | manual | Idempotency is a backend invariant; verify via integration tests, not UI. |
